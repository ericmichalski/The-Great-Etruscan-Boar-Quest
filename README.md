# The Great Etruscan Boar Quest
A text RPG that sends the player to the depths of an ancient Etruscan temple on a hunt for the grand Etruscan boar vessel.
Along the way, the user will have to use their wits, memory, intuition and arsenal of items to survive the threats, steal the boar and escape.<br />
This is also one of my first C++ projects.
